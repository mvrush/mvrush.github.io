        <h2>Fishin' In Paradise</h2>
        <img class="articleimage" src="images/fishhaven/fishhavenarticle.jpg" alt="kid fishing at fish haven">
        <p>
            The name Fish Haven is a very well deserved monikor for this unbelievably beautiful spot. One of the most gorgeous places on planet earth, Fish Haven is truly a place of refuge for our fine finned friends. Trout and salmon fill this gorgeous section of lake. For this reason, many people come to Fish Haven to live, work and play.
        </p>
        <p>
            Local resident Jimmy Cass Elliot moved to Fish Haven for this very reason. He loved to fish more than just about anything else in the entire world. When Jimmy was a child he came to Fish Haven one summer with his scout group. In his journal he wrote "I must have caught 100 fish in one day!" When Jimmy became a man, he moved to Fish Haven to fulfill his love of fishing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Jimmy could often be seen sitting on the pier baiting up a hook and singing songs about the Soda Spring Geyser. If you came to Jimmy's shack in the evening you would be greeted by the smell of fresh frying breaded fish. Jimmy often called Fish Haven heaven on earth.
        </p>
        <p>
            Last Tuesday Jimmy was at his usual spot on the pier when the pier finally gave way. Jimmy plunged into the waters along with his bait box and fishing pole. Jimmy did not surface because Jimmy had never learned how to swim. In his old scout journal he had written "I ain't got time to earn the Swimming merit badge. I'm too busy fishin'!" 
        </p>
        <P class="clearfix">
            Let us all remember the fine fellow Jimmy was and learn from his mistakes. Always remember that as fine as fishing is, if you're going to spend a lot of time around water, it is a very good idea to learn how to swim. Let us remember Jimmy and take comfort in knowing that Jimmy is now Fishin' In Paradise!
        </P>
