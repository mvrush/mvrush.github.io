            <h3>White Space</h3>
            <p>Musician's Friend</p>
            <a href="https://www.musiciansfriend.com" target="_blank">musiciansfriend.com</a>
            <img src="images\Musicians_Friend_White_Space_360x640.jpg">
            <p>Musician’s Friend uses white space very effectively on their mobile layout. Their use of white space really enhances their page structure by clearly separating each call-to-action area. There is no mistaking that the Rewards call-to-action area is completely separate from the Stupid Deal of the Day call-to-action.</p>

            <h3>Visual Heirarchy</h3>
            <p>Fender Guitars</p>
            <a href="https://www.fender.com" target="_blank">Fender Guitars</a>
            <img src="images\Fender_Guitars_Visual_Heirarchy_360x640.jpg">
            <p>Fender Guitars employs visual heirarchy to great effect. With the use of font size they make it very clear that you are looking at the 2021 New Releases. From there the red jumps out at the reader. The name Fender at the top of the page lets you know what brand of guitar you are looking at. Next the reader notices the word “New” set in bright red boxes that match the logo. Finally the call to action button is also highlighted in red below the guitars. This is visual heirarchy in action.</p>

            <h3>PARC: Contrast</h3>
            <p>Runner's World</p>
            <a href="https://www.runnersworld.com" target="_blank">Runner's World</a>
            <img src="images\Runner's_World_Contrast_360x640.jpg">
            <p>Runner’s World uses contrast to great effect. The huge white box set at the bottom of the homogoneus mix of runners immediately draws your eye to it. Right below that is the company name and website menu with a large blue call-to-action button. That large blue box uses the rule of contrast against the black header to really make it stand out.</p>
